## Milestone 3 (4th June, 5pm)

**80% of the final grade**

For the final milestone, you need to create a cool, interactive, and sufficiently complex D3.js (and other) data viz on the dataset you chose. Tell a data story and explain it to the targeted audience. Create a process book that details how you got there, from the original idea to the final product.

You need to deliver the following things:
1. Github repository with a [README](../README.md)
* Host the code and data on Github with your process book as a PDF file [here](./process_book.pdf)
* Add a [README](../wa-visualization/README.md) file that explains the technical setup and intended usage
* Code should be clean, manageable, and using the latest practices
2. Screencast
* Demonstrate what you can do with your viz in a fun, engaging and impactful manner
* Talk about your main contributions rather than on technical details
* The 2 min video can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nbVBNSENsk2Auo-obHa2WsYavL-OOQFK/view).
3. Process book (max 8 pages)
* Describe the path you took to obtain the final result
* Explain challenges that you faced and design decisions that you took
* Reuse the sketches/plans that you made for the first milestone, expanding them and explaining the changes
* Care about the visual/design of this report
* Peer assessment: include a breakdown of the parts of the project completed by each team member.

The grading is the following:
* Visualization (35%)
* Technical Implementation (15%)
* Screencast (25%)
* Process book (25%)

Grades may vary across the team members, based on the process book and the
peer assessment process. Please provide clear explanations.
